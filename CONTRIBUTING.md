# Contributing to Mirador

First: thank you. Mirador is a portfolio demo project — contributions
improve the "real-world how-to-operate-this-thing" value for everyone
who reads it later.

## Where to contribute

**GitLab is the canonical source.** Contributions happen there.

- Service: [gitlab.com/mirador1/mirador-ui](https://gitlab.com/mirador1/mirador-ui)
- UI: [gitlab.com/mirador1/mirador-ui](https://gitlab.com/mirador1/mirador-ui)

The GitHub repos (`github.com/mirador1/mirador-*`) are read-only
mirrors. Issues and PRs opened there will not be reviewed — the
repo description points here. See
[`docs/ops/ci-philosophy.md`](docs/ops/ci-philosophy.md) for why.

## Types of contributions we welcome

| Type | How to start |
|---|---|
| **Bug report** | Open a [GitLab issue](https://gitlab.com/mirador1/mirador-ui/-/issues/new) with the "bug" template. |
| **Security vulnerability** | **Do not open a public issue.** See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md). |
| **Documentation fix / clarification** | Open an MR directly. Docs-only MRs are merged fastest. |
| **New ADR / architectural suggestion** | Open an issue first to discuss the problem + alternatives before writing the ADR. |
| **New runbook** | Open an MR adding a file to [`docs/ops/runbooks/`](docs/ops/runbooks/) following the 5-heading template in the README there. |
| **New feature** | Open an issue + link an ADR draft. Features that don't advance the demo scenarios are usually declined (see [ADR-0021](docs/adr/0021-cost-deferred-industrial-patterns.md)). |
| **Dependency bump** | Renovate does this automatically. Manual bumps of critical libs (Spring Boot major, Java LTS) are accepted with a short ADR. |

## Development workflow

### 1. Set up

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/mirador1/mirador-ui.git
cd mirador-service
bin/mirador-doctor   # one-command health check — must be all green
```

If any check fails, follow the advice in the output. `bin/mirador-
doctor --no-cost` skips the GCP checks if you're offline.

### 2. Branch + commit

Work on `dev`. The project uses
[trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com):
single working branch, squash-merged to `main` via MR.

```bash
git checkout dev
# make your changes
git add ...
git commit -m "feat(scope): short subject under 72 chars"
```

**Conventional Commits are mandatory.** Enforced by
`lefthook` commit-msg hook + commitlint config. Accepted types:

```
feat | fix | docs | style | refactor | perf | test |
build | ci | chore | revert
```

Scope is optional but useful (`feat(auth): ...`, `fix(ci): ...`).

### 3. Push + open MR

```bash
bin/ship.sh "feat(scope): short subject"
```

This one command:
1. Pushes `dev` (force-with-lease — safe in solo-dev workflow)
2. Opens or updates the MR dev → main with squash-before-merge
3. Arms auto-merge when the pipeline succeeds

Or run each step manually with `git push` + `glab mr create` + the
auto-merge call — `ship.sh --dry-run` prints the exact commands.

### 4. Wait for CI

Green CI on the MR triggers the auto-merge. The pipeline stages
(see [`docs/ops/ci-variables.md`](docs/ops/ci-variables.md)):

```
lint → test → integration → k8s → package → compat →
native → sonar → reports → infra → deploy
```

Most are fast (unit + integration = 3 min). Docker image build,
kind-in-CI validation and mutation tests take longer. `allow_failure:
true` on optional stages means one red doesn't block merge.

### 5. Sync `dev` after merge

Handled automatically by `bin/ship.sh --wait`. Or manually:

```bash
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/main
git push origin dev --force-with-lease
```

After a squash-merge, `dev` has the pre-squash commits with content
already on `main`. Reset-to-main is the clean re-baseline.

## Code conventions

### Java / Spring Boot

- **Default stack**: SB4 + Java 25.
- **Compat matrix**: keep the other profiles (SB4+Java21, SB4+Java17,
  SB3+Java21, SB3+Java17) passing. If your change breaks one, note
  why in the commit message.
- **No `@Autowired` field injection**. Constructor injection only.
- **No deprecated Spring Boot flags or APIs.**
- **Flyway migration versions** are immutable — never modify a
  `V_N__*.sql` that's already in `main`. Bump the version.

### Angular (UI repo)

- **Angular 21 zoneless** — no `fakeAsync`, no `tick()`, no
  `detectChanges()` in tests.
- Use `@if`, `@for`, `@switch` — not `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`.
- Prefer `signal()` and `computed()` over `ngModel`.
- Charts in raw SVG (no charting library).

### Comments

Comments explain **why**, not what. Write comments that a future
maintainer with no conversation history can understand.

Good: `// Rate limit matches Cloudflare's DDoS threshold per IP.`
Bad: `// Set rate limit.`

### Tests

- Unit tests run on every MR.
- Integration tests (Testcontainers) run on every MR.
- E2E tests (Playwright, planned — ROADMAP Tier-1 #2) run in kind-in-CI.
- Mutation tests (PIT) run on main + nightly.
- Every new `@Service` or `@RestController` gets at least one unit
  test. Every new API endpoint gets at least one integration test.

### Documentation

- **Any new ADR-worthy decision gets an ADR**. See the criteria in
  [`docs/adr/README.md`](docs/adr/README.md). Code-style or
  bug-fix decisions do NOT get an ADR.
- **Any new `$VAR` in `.gitlab-ci.yml`** gets a row in
  [`docs/ops/ci-variables.md`](docs/ops/ci-variables.md) in the
  same commit.
- **Any new runbook** follows the 5-heading template.
- **READMEs in EN + FR** — a lefthook hook blocks a commit that
  touches one without the other. Skip with `LEFTHOOK=0 git commit`
  if the edit is intentionally one-sided.

## ADR format

See the existing ADRs — all follow Michael Nygard's format:

```markdown
# ADR-NNNN — Short verb-phrase title

- **Status**: Accepted / Superseded / Deprecated
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Related**: (optional) cross-refs

## Context
(What's the situation? What constraints are in play?)

## Decision
(What have we decided to do?)

## Consequences
### Positive / Negative / Neutral

## Alternatives considered
| Option | Why rejected |

## Revisit this when
(What would flip the decision?)
```

New ADRs get the next number (`0032`, `0033`, …). Numbering is
monotonic even when an ADR supersedes another.

## Merge policy

- **Squash-merge** into `main`. Keeps history linear, one MR = one
  commit on main.
- **`main` is protected** — no direct push.
- **Source branch preserved** (`--remove-source-branch=false`) — we
  keep `dev` alive always.
- **Auto-merge allowed** when MWPS is armed + CI green.

## Review

This is a solo-maintained project. Reviews happen asynchronously.
If your MR has been idle for a week without feedback, a polite ping
in a comment is welcome.

Heuristics the maintainer applies:

- Does the change advance a demo scenario, or solve a concrete
  problem?
- Is the ADR discipline preserved (new decisions have ADRs; non-
  decisions don't)?
- Does the CI stay green?
- Are docs updated?
- Does the commit message explain *why* in the body?

## What gets declined

- Changes that add dependencies without a clear scenario.
- Code-style churn for its own sake.
- Features that require a paid SaaS to demo (ADR-0022 budget).
- "Modernisations" of patterns that work — if a demo scenario
  doesn't break, the pattern stays.

## Acknowledgements

The project is built in close collaboration with an LLM — see the
"AI-assisted integration" section in the README. Contributors are
welcome to use the same tooling. Human review remains the authority
on scope and arbitrage.

doesn't answer, open an issue with the label `question`.
